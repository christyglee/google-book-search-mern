 ## Description 
We created a new React-based app called Google Book Search. This assignment required us to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. 

## Process
We used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save their favorite books to review or purchase later.

Here is our Google Book Search in action!:

 ## Installation
 To create your own Google Book Search app, you will need VS code and the dependencies are axios, express, if-env, mongoose and react-router-dom.
 
 ## Usage 
This application is great for anyone who wants to search specific books. It's helpful because the user can save their books as well.
